# 🎯 Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to leverage advanced machine learning (ML) and structure-from-motion (SFM) techniques to estimate vehicle speeds accurately from various types of imagery. This work aims to provide valuable tools and methodologies applicable to fields like traffic monitoring, autonomous vehicle systems, and improving road safety.

# 📸 Dataset
This repository does not include a publicly available dataset. Instead, the methods are designed for use with custom datasets. If you possess specific imagery or are interested in applying these techniques, we encourage you to get in touch for collaboration opportunities.

# 📋 System Requirements
To execute the code in this repository, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

Python 3.7+: Install Python and set up the required libraries using pip:

bash
