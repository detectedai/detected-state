🎯 Project Objectives

This project aims to utilize advanced ML and SFM approaches to accurately estimate vehicle speeds from various forms of imagery. By doing so, we hope to contribute valuable tools and methods that can be applied in domains such as traffic monitoring, autonomous driving systems, and road safety enhancements.

## 📸 Dataset

Currently, we do not provide a public dataset alongside this repository; the methods are tailored for use with custom datasets. If you have specific imagery or are interested in applying these techniques, please reach out for collaboration.

# 📋 Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following:

- **Python 3.7+**: Install Python and use pip to set up the necessary libraries:

  ```
  pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
  ```

  The `requirements.txt` file includes key Python packages such as:

  - `numpy`
  - `scipy`
  - `torch` (PyTorch)
  - `opencv-python` (OpenCV)
  - `exifread`
  - `bokeh` (optional, for visualization)

  ```

  ```

  
  ```
  >> addpath(genpath('/functions-matlab'))
  ```

  Ensure you have the following MATLAB toolboxes installed:

  - `Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox`
  - `Signal Processing Toolbox`

# 🏃 Run
